# Airport Security Check Simulation

This project simulates the security check process at an airport using discrete event simulation in Python. The simulation aims to model the passenger flow, queue lengths, and inspection processes under probabilistic conditions.

### ✈️ Problem Description

- **Passenger Arrival:** Every 5 ± 2 minutes (uniform distribution)
- **Inspection Time:** Exponentially distributed with mean of 10 minutes
- **Failure Rate:** 5% of passengers fail the identification check
- **Objective:** Run simulation until 100 passengers are denied entry

### 📊 Key Metrics (Sample Run)
- **Total simulation time:** ~19343 minutes
- **Average queue length:** ~960
- **Maximum queue length:** ~1913
